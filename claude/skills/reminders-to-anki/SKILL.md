description: Review unfinished macOS Reminders with reminders-cli, identify language-learning notes intended for Anki, turn them into useful non-duplicate cards, verify and sync Anki, and complete only the successfully processed reminders. Use when the user asks to process, extract, register, or continue Anki items from Reminders or reminders-cli.

# Process Reminders into Anki

Use `reminders-cli` to find pending learning notes and the `anki-add-cards`
skill to add or update the appropriate cards.

## Preconditions

1. Run `command -v reminders`.
2. Use `/opt/homebrew/bin/reminders` when the Homebrew command is not on PATH.
3. If macOS denies Reminders access, request permission and retry. Do not use
   another data source as a workaround.
4. Read and follow the sibling `anki-add-cards` skill before accessing Anki.

## Workflow

1. List unfinished reminders as JSON:

   ```bash
   reminders show-all --format json
   ```

2. Select only reminders clearly intended for language learning or Anki.
   - Prefer explicit titles such as `Anki追加:` or `Ankiカード修正:`.
   - Use the title and notes together; one reminder may produce several cards.
   - Ignore unrelated tasks even when they contain foreign words.
   - Use `--include-completed` only to inspect prior conventions. Do not
     reprocess completed reminders unless the user asks.
3. Review the learning content before writing.
   - Correct spelling, capitalization, grammar, and unnatural phrasing.
   - Preserve the original meaning and degree. Do not silently turn
     `a little harder` into `harder`, for example.
   - Distinguish close alternatives when the reminder calls them out.
   - Prefer one corrected sentence plus separate reusable expressions when that
     matches nearby Anki cards.
   - Avoid low-value cards that merely repeat the sentence.
   - Ask the user when a correction or intended meaning remains ambiguous.
4. Inspect Anki using `anki-add-cards`.
   - Match the deck, note type, fields, HTML style, and tags of related cards.
   - Search every proposed primary field for duplicates.
   - Use `canAddNotes` before a batch insertion.
   - Do not hardcode a language, deck, note type, or field name.
5. Apply the reviewed changes.
   - Add new notes with duplicate prevention enabled.
   - Update an existing note only when the reminder explicitly requests a
     correction or the user authorizes the update.
   - Retain all returned note IDs.
6. Verify every resulting note with `notesInfo` and its placement with
   `cardsInfo`.
7. Sync Anki.
   - Explain that `sync` may transfer every pending change in the active Anki
     profile, not only this reminder's cards.
   - Obtain explicit permission for that full-profile sync unless the user's
     request already grants it.
   - Call the AnkiConnect `sync` action and require a null error.
8. Complete the source reminder only after all additions or updates,
   verification, and the required sync succeed:

   ```bash
   reminders complete "<list>" "<externalId>"
   ```

9. Run `reminders show-all --format json` again and verify that the processed
   reminder is no longer unfinished.

## Failure handling

- Keep the reminder unfinished when review, Anki mutation, verification, or
  required sync fails.
- On a partial Anki batch, report the successful note IDs. On retry, detect
  those notes as duplicates instead of adding them again.
- If the user declines full-profile sync, leave the reminder unfinished unless
  the user explicitly accepts local-only completion.
- Never delete a reminder as a substitute for completing it.

## Report

Report:

- the processed reminder title;
- the cards added, updated, or skipped;
- the deck and note type;
- the note IDs;
- sync status;
- reminder completion status.
