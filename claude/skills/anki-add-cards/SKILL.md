name: anki-add-cards
description: Inspect a local Anki collection and add one or more notes through AnkiConnect, regardless of language or subject. Use when the user asks to create, register, or append Anki cards; mentions AnkiConnect; or wants new notes to match an existing deck, note type, fields, formatting, and tags without creating duplicates.
---

# Add Anki cards

Inspect and update the user's running Anki collection through AnkiConnect's
local HTTP API. Use `curl` and JSON; no language-specific runtime is required.

## Workflow

1. Start Anki when AnkiConnect is unavailable.
   - On macOS, run `open -a Anki`.
   - Wait for the profile to finish loading.
   - Call `version` at `http://127.0.0.1:8765`.
   - If the endpoint still fails, ask the user to install or enable AnkiConnect.
2. Inspect before writing.
   - Call `deckNames` and `modelNames`.
   - Call `modelFieldNames` for the selected note type.
   - When the destination or format is implicit, inspect relevant recent notes
     with `findNotes`, `notesInfo`, and `cardsInfo`. Prefer matching the user's
     existing organization over inventing a new deck or note type.
3. Prepare the requested content.
   - Do not assume a language, translation direction, or field semantics.
   - Preserve meaningful HTML used by nearby notes.
   - Add explanations, examples, pronunciations, or tags only when requested or
     strongly established by the neighboring cards.
4. Check for duplicates.
   - Search for the exact primary-field text with `findNotes`.
   - Keep duplicate prevention enabled when adding. Do not use
     `options.allowDuplicate: true` unless the user explicitly requests a
     duplicate.
5. Preview and add.
   - Build the complete `addNote` or `addNotes` payload and inspect it before
     sending it when field mapping is uncertain.
   - Keep `options.allowDuplicate` set to `false`.
   - Retain every returned note ID.
6. Verify the result with `notesInfo` and, when deck placement matters,
   `cardsInfo`. Report the deck, note type, and added note IDs.
7. Sync after a successful addition.
   - Explain that AnkiConnect's `sync` action may transfer every pending change
     in the active Anki profile, not only the notes just added.
   - Obtain explicit permission for that full-profile sync, then call `sync`
     after verifying all newly added notes.
   - Do not sync after a dry run or when no note was added.
   - If sync fails, report that the notes exist locally and that only remote
     synchronization remains incomplete.

## Requests

Send JSON as UTF-8. AnkiConnect responses contain `result` and `error`; treat a
non-null `error` as failure even when the HTTP request succeeds.

```bash
curl --silent --show-error --max-time 10 \
  http://127.0.0.1:8765 \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"action":"deckNames","version":6}'
```

For dynamic note content, use `jq` to encode field values safely instead of
hand-escaping user text:

```bash
jq -n \
  --arg deck 'Default' \
  --arg model 'Basic' \
  --arg front 'Question' \
  --arg back 'Answer' \
  '{
    action: "addNote",
    version: 6,
    params: {
      note: {
        deckName: $deck,
        modelName: $model,
        fields: {Front: $front, Back: $back},
        options: {allowDuplicate: false},
        tags: []
      }
    }
  }' |
  curl --silent --show-error --max-time 10 \
    http://127.0.0.1:8765 \
    -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-binary @-
```

Use `addNotes` for a batch. Match the field names returned by
`modelFieldNames`; do not assume `Front` and `Back`.

## Safety

- Treat adding notes as an external write and ensure it is within the user's
  request.
- Never create, rename, move, update, or delete decks, note types, notes, or
  cards unless the user requested that specific change.
- Never infer permission to overwrite an existing note from a request to add a
  card.
- Surface AnkiConnect errors verbatim enough for the user to act on them.
